Description: PostGIS 2.0 has been deprecated - please migrate your databases
 The package postgresql-@PGVERSION@-postgis-2.0-scripts is installed on this
 system, which means you likely use the PostGIS extension in some
 databases.
 .
 Debian is now shipping PostGIS version 2.1 and dropped support for
 2.0, meaning bug or security fixes will no longer be provided for the
 older one. Thus it is strongly recommended to migrate all databases
 to PostGIS 2.1 as soon as possible.
 .
 Of course, databases that are already using PostGIS 2.0 will continue
 to work. Note, however, that with this upgrade it's no longer
 possible to create version 2.0 of the extension PostGIS. Instead,
 'CREATE EXTENSION postgis;' will now give you version 2.1. Note that
 this also affects backups.
