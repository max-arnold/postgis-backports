Package: postgis
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: postgresql-NEWEST_PGVERSION-postgis-2.1
Description: Geographic objects support for PostgreSQL
 PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL
 object-relational database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially enables"
 the PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a backend spatial
 database for geographic information systems (GIS), much like ESRI's
 SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension. PostGIS follows the OpenGIS
 "Simple Features Specification for SQL".
 .
 This package contains the PostGIS userland binaries, common files.

Package: postgis-doc

Description: Geographic objects support for PostgreSQL -- documentation
 PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL
 object-relational database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially enables"
 the PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a backend spatial
 database for geographic information systems (GIS), much like ESRI's
 SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension. PostGIS follows the OpenGIS

 This library is the generic geometry handling section of PostGIS. The
 geometry objects, constructors, destructors, and a set of spatial
 processing functions, are implemented here.

Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: PostGIS for PostgreSQL PGVERSION -- scripts -- dummy package
 This package contained SQL scripts to upgrade from earlier PostGIS
 versions for PostgreSQL PGVERSION as well as Perl utility scripts.
 It got renamed to postgresql-PGVERSION-postgis-scripts.
 .
 This is a transitional dummy package. It can safely be removed.
