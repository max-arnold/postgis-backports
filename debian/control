Package: postgis
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: postgresql-9.2-postgis-2.0
Description: Geographic objects support for PostgreSQL
 PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL
 object-relational database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially enables"
 the PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a backend spatial
 database for geographic information systems (GIS), much like ESRI's
 SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension. PostGIS follows the OpenGIS
 "Simple Features Specification for SQL".
 .
 This package contains the PostGIS userland binaries, common files.

Description: Geographic objects support for PostgreSQL -- documentation
 PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL
 object-relational database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially enables"
 the PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a backend spatial
 database for geographic information systems (GIS), much like ESRI's
 SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension. PostGIS follows the OpenGIS

 This library is the generic geometry handling section of PostGIS. The
 geometry objects, constructors, destructors, and a set of spatial
 processing functions, are implemented here.
