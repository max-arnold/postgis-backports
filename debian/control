Package: postgis
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Suggests: postgresql-9.1-postgis-2.0
Description: Geographic objects support for PostgreSQL
 PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL
 object-relational database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially enables"
 the PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a backend spatial
 database for geographic information systems (GIS), much like ESRI's
 SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension. PostGIS follows the OpenGIS
 "Simple Features Specification for SQL".
 .
 This package contains the PostGIS userland binaries, common files.

Package: postgis-doc

 the PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a backend spatial
 database for geographic information systems (GIS), much like ESRI's
 SDE or Oracle's Spatial extension. PostGIS follows the OpenGIS

Description: Geographic objects support for PostgreSQL -- JDBC support
 PostGIS adds support for geographic objects to the PostgreSQL
 object-relational database. In effect, PostGIS "spatially enables"
 the PostgreSQL server, allowing it to be used as a backend spatial
 database for geographic information systems (GIS), much like ESRI's

 This library is the generic geometry handling section of PostGIS. The
 geometry objects, constructors, destructors, and a set of spatial
 processing functions, are implemented here.
